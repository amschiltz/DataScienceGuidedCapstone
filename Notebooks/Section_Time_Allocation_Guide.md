## Focus Priorities by Learning Level

### Beginner (6+ hours total)
- Spend extra time on sections 4.7 (metrics), 4.8 (pipelines), and 4.9 (cross-validation)
- Take breaks between major sections
- Practice running code multiple times with different parameters

### Intermediate (4-5 hours total)
- Focus on understanding the workflow and best practices
- Spend more time on GridSearchCV and model comparison
- Experiment with different hyperparameters

### Advanced (3-4 hours total)
- Skim basics, focus on methodology and business interpretation
- Spend time on sections 4.11 (model selection) and 4.14 (summary)
- Consider how to adapt techniques to other problems

## Key Time-Savers
1. **Don't get stuck on code syntax** - focus on concepts
2. **Use the table of contents** to navigate efficiently
3. **Run code first, understand later** for complex sections
4. **Take notes** on key insights rather than trying to memorize everything

## Most Important Sections
The most important sections for long-term learning are:
- **4.7 (metrics)** - Understanding model evaluation
- **4.8.2 (pipelines)** - Professional ML workflow
- **4.9.7-4.9.8 (cross-validation and grid search)** - Model selection
- **4.11 (model selection)** - Business decision making

These form the foundation of professional ML workflows.
