## **Slide 2: Market Context** *(2-3 minutes)*

### **Title:** Big Mountain's Competitive Disconnect

### **Key Points:**
- Top quartile facilities across key metrics: runs, lifts, vertical drop, snow making
- Pricing 15% below market potential for comparable resort quality
- Facility quality drives pricing more than location (analysis of 277 resorts)
- Strong correlations: ticket prices vs. runs (0.76), fast quads (0.73), vertical drop (0.71)

### **Figure:** Feature distribution plot from EDA showing Big Mountain's position (red line) vs. industry distribution

### **Executive Message:** 
"We have premium facilities but budget pricing - clear opportunity to capture fair market value."

### **Presenter Notes:**
- Validate that quality justifies higher prices
- Use correlation numbers - executives love data that supports decisions

## **Slide 3: Strategic Opportunities** *(3-4 minutes)*

### **Title:** Revenue Optimization Strategy - Clear Winner Emerges

### **Key Points:**
- **Pricing optimization: $26M annual revenue** (highest ROI, immediate implementation)
- Facility expansion: $1.9M profit (125% ROI, requires capital investment)
- Run closures: $0 to -$2.2M impact (operational savings needed to justify)
- Snow making upgrades: No additional pricing power beyond base expansion

### **Figure:** ‚≠ê **COMPLETE ROI comparison horizontal bar chart** (from `05_modeling_ams.ipynb`)
- **This is your "money slide"**
- Shows all 5 scenarios for complete strategic picture
- Visual dramatically shows $26M dwarfing other options

### **Executive Message:** 
"Pricing optimization delivers 13x more value than facility expansion with zero capital investment."

### **Presenter Notes:**
- This chart will generate the most discussion - be prepared for questions
- Emphasize immediate implementation (no capex required)
- Position facility expansion as solid secondary option
- Be honest about run closure risks
- Use this slide to drive decision hierarchy

## **Slide 4: Model Performance & Validation** *(2 minutes)*

### **Title:** Robust Analysis Supports Recommendations

### **Key Points:**
- **Random Forest model: 75% accuracy** vs. 60% for linear regression
- Average prediction error: $9.54 (vs. $19.13 baseline guessing)
- Cross-validated on 277 ski resorts across 25 facility variables
- Model selection prioritized reliability over complexity for business decisions

### **Figure:** Model comparison chart (Random Forest vs Linear Regression performance from preprocessing notebook)

## **Slide 5: Big Mountain's Pricing Power** *(2-3 minutes)*

### **Title:** Why Big Mountain Can Command Premium Pricing

### **Key Points:**
- **Top pricing drivers:** Fast quads (0.73), vertical drop (0.71), runs (0.76), snow making (0.70)
- Big Mountain excels in all key categories but prices below market potential
- Facility quality drives pricing more than location across 277 resort analysis
- Model validates premium pricing strategy with 75% accuracy

### **Figure:** Feature correlation heatmap OR horizontal bar chart of top correlations with ticket price

### **Executive Message:** 
"We have the facilities that justify premium pricing - the data proves it."

### **Presenter Notes:**
- This slide validates the $26M pricing opportunity
- Visual evidence is more compelling than just stating numbers
- Shows comprehensive analysis behind recommendations
- Reinforces that pricing increase is data-driven, not arbitrary

## **Slide 6: Facility Investment Scenarios** *(2-3 minutes)*

### **Title:** Additional Value Creation Opportunities

### **Key Points:**
- **Facility expansion: $1.9M annual profit** (new run + 150ft vertical + chairlift)
- 125% ROI on infrastructure investment - strong business case
- Run closures: Minimal revenue impact (1-2 runs) vs. major risk (6+ runs)
- Snow making/longest run upgrades: No additional pricing power

### **Figure:** Implementation timeline or facility expansion breakdown (NO duplicate ROI chart)

### **Executive Message:** 
"Facility expansion offers solid returns, but pricing optimization remains our primary opportunity."

### **Presenter Notes:**
- Position facility investments as "nice to have" vs. pricing as "must have"
- Be specific about facility expansion details
- Acknowledge run closure risks honestly
- Reference back to Slide 3: "As we saw in our strategic overview..."
